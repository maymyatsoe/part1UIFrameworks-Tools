Text editor of your choice: Any text editor that you are already familiar with can be used for editing the project files.
 I will be using Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor of choice in this specialization. 
 You may also consider other editors such as Brackets (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/), 
 or Atom (https://atom.io/).

Command line shell: Familiarity with the command-line shell will be essential for the exercises. In Windows a cmd window 
or power shell with admin privileges would be needed. On a Mac or in Linux, a terminal window can be used. Please get
 familiar with the "sudo" command in OS X and Linux.
