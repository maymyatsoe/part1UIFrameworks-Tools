Setting up your Development Environment
Software Requirements
Text editor of your choice: Any text editor that you are already familiar with can be used for editing the project files.
 I will be using Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor of choice in this specialization. 
 You may also consider other editors such as Brackets (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/), 
 or Atom (https://atom.io/).
Browser of your choice: You may use your preferred browser. I will be using Chrome as the browser in all the exercises. 
All the exercises and assignments in this course have been tested using Chrome v. 46. Please note that not all browsers 
may support all the HTML5 features to the same extent. You might encounter problems when using other browsers. I strongly
 urge you to use the latest Chrome browser for the exercises and assignments in this course so that any problems are 
 minimized.
Command line shell: Familiarity with the command-line shell will be essential for the exercises. In Windows a cmd window 
or power shell with admin privileges would be needed. On a Mac or in Linux, a terminal window can be used. Please get
 familiar with the "sudo" command in OS X and Linux.
Files required for the exercises: We will provide additional starter files for the exercises wherever needed. Links to 
download the files will be provided inline in the exercise instructions that follow each exercise video. Please download
 the files provided there, if any, before beginning the exercise. The links are also available through the Additional 
 Resources of the specific lesson.
Note: Please remember to retain the folders and all the files that you create in the exercises. Further exercises will
 build upon the files that you create in the preceding exercises. DO NOT DELETE the files at the end of the exercises,
  unless otherwise instructed. You may wish to set up your exercise folder as a Git repository and commit the files to
   the repository at the end of each exercise.
